# Compliance gaming starter

## Setup
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/nmnj90/compliance-test.git`
2. Make sure you have [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. (Installing Node should also install NPM, automatically)
3. In the project's root, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage
There are two commands you can run:
  * `npm run build-css`: runs the basic node-sass compilation task.
  * `npm run watch-css`: runs a "watch" task, that will watch your Sass files for changes, and upon detecting a change, will automatically run the `build-css` task to re-compile your Sass.
